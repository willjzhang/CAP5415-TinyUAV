# TinyUAV
### CAP5415- Computer Vision

A modification of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for the detection of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in images. This version uses modified weights in order to recognize UAVs.


### Prerequisites

Follow the instructions on the following sites to install the corresponding prerequisites.
* Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
* Keras: https://keras.io/#installation
* OpenCV: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

* keras-metrics: https://github.com/netrack/keras-metrics

### Dataset preprocessing

1- Download the dataset from https://engineering.purdue.edu/~bouman/UAV_Dataset/ (both videos and annotations)

2- Assuming the videos are located at path\datasets\videos, copy V2F.py in the same directory and then run the script to convert the videos into image frames (output images will appear in the directory in jpg format).

3- Assuming the frames were kept at path\datasets\videos,

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
